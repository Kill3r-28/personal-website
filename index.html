      <p>Here I put out everything I can't express anywhere else.</p>
      <p>To speak of profession, I'm current working as a Project Manager at an Edu-Tech company. Over it, I'm learning Cloud
        techonologies and data engineering. My interests lie in bringing tangible results to life. The clearer the outcomes, the 
        better is my will to work.
      </p>
      <p>Speaking of the <b>other side</b>, I'm a connoiseur of movies, books and podcasts. I'm most fascinated by people and their lives. 
        I want to share my interests on these pages, in case someone finds them interesting.
