        <h2>how I brought this website to life</h2>
        <p>It started with me figuring out ways to upskill.</p>
        <p>I find a lot interesting and successful people on internet 
            and I realised what's making them special (soon I'll post a page paying special mention to all of them). I found one common point in all of their online profiles - each one of them either had a website or a blog putting their thoughts to words. I understood the essence behind this - in the age of information, utilising this space is a winning move. And I convinced myself to make that winning move.</p>
        
        <p>Building this website was an answer to <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">cloud resume challenge.</a> Check it out, its an interesting side project for anyone looking for fun. This is how I did it -</p>
        <ol>
          <li>first I wrote some basic html and css to make a static webpage</li>
          <li>I vibe coded html and css and made basic planning about the folder structure and navigation in the website - this important to make a scalable website with more articles in future</li>
          <li>then, created an aws account for free and created a public s3 bucket for storing the files of website - AWS provides free services for six months and upto $200 of free credit</li>
          <li>I learnt some new concepts about domain naming system, http and https, hosting services</li>
          <li>I referred this <a href="https://naveend3v.medium.com/my-cloud-resume-challenge-project-6f726ed58d60">article</a> a lot in this process - a big thank you to him</li>
          <li>the below image pictorally shows the flow this website follows</li>
          <p><img src="https://nxtwave-assessments-backend-nxtwave-media-static.s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/topin_beta/media/content_loading/uploads/2110c720-9296-4cc3-87b1-c7647fb11663_Screenshot%202025-11-12%20at%2018.33.22.png"></p>
          <li>AWS Amplify has simplified hosting to a large extent. In the article I cited above there was a need to work around with Cloud Front and Route53 - these are now handled by Amplify.</li>
          <li>only drawback I found in this route is relaunching the amplify app everytime some changes are uploaded to S3 bucket - maybe I'll change this flow in future as I learn more about it</li>
        </ol>
        <p>thank you for reading ! :)</p>
