        <h2>how I brought this website to life</h2>
        <p>It started with me figuring out ways to upskill.</p>
        <p>I find a lot interesting and successful people on internet 
            and I realised what's making them special (soon I'll post a page paying special mention to all of them). I found one common point in all of their online profiles - each one of them either had a website or a blog putting their thoughts to words. I understood the essence behind this - in the age of information, utilising this space is a winning move. And I convinced myself to make that winning move.</p>
        <p>Its not that this is my first shot at writing online. I had occasionally written some articles/answers on quora but I couldn't maintain that consistency. This time I want to maintain the mileage.</p>
        <p>Now, coming to the point, building this website was an answer to <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">cloud resume challenge.</a> Check it out, its an interesting side for anyone looking for fun. This is how I did it -</p>
        <ol>
          <li>first I wrote some basic html and css (taking inspiration from one of the personalities I was talking about earlier)</li>
          <li>I vibe coded html and css and made basic planning about the folder structure and navigation in the website</li>
          <li>then, created an aws account for free and created a public s3 bucket for storing the files of website</li>
          <li>I learnt some new concepts about domain naming system, http and https, hosting services.</li>
          <li>I referred this <a href="https://naveend3v.medium.com/my-cloud-resume-challenge-project-6f726ed58d60">article</a> a lot in this process - a big thank you to him</li>
          <li></li>
