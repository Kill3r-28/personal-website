        <h2>how I brought this website to life</h2>
        <p>It started with me figuring out ways to upskill. I'm a great explorer on internet, I come across many interesting personalities online
            and I observe what's making them special (soon I'll post a page paying special mention to them). So, in this exploration, 
            one outstanding point I noticed with everyone was that they were all posting "how to" articles on tech related topics. And some more were posting blogs, especially tech blogs.
        </p>
        <p>Even I had a desire to write online but I was being overpowered by imposter syndrome. But still, occassionally I was posting  
            my writing over Quora and some more blog pages of my college portal.
        </p>
        <p>But they were not following a specific topic or line of thought. Now, time has come that I put my writings with learnings into more organised pages.</p>
        <p>Coming to the topic of the page, this website has been hosted through AWS amplify from an S3
